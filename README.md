# Capstone-project
This repository is meant for the capstone project where i work on location data and different problems that can be solved using location data from foursquare API.

- This project aims to predict a suitable location for the construction of student hostels.

trying to identify the right locations in the state of New York for establishing hostels so that it can be profitable as well as budget friendly.
